<p>She created this beautiful creature on 9 October,with the help of her dear friend,Patrick Wu. Lizzy is an enthusiast of computer. Though she has never learned coding before,but she has always been dreaming of using the computer well. That's pretty cool for a girl!  Lizzy isn't sure whether to be a computer scientist in the future,but she's convinced that coding will bring her great happiness. What's more,she loves listening to Patrick's detailed instructions and follow them like a real expert,this makes her feel on top of the world. Anyway,please remember that,Lizzy realized her dream of entering the field of computer science on 9 October,and this is only the very beginning.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
